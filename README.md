# Title of Project: 
  Eyes

## Description:
  This Project has a pair of eyes created using CSS and HTML follow the movements of the mouse as it travels around the screen.
  
## How to Run:
this code doesn't need any third party packages to run. simply download the files to your desktop and then drag the index.html folder into your browser

## Future Improvements:
In the future I would like to make the eyes smaller and find famous paintings of people and use them as a backgroud overlway for the eyes. This would require moving the eyes on the screen so they line up with the images, but I think it would be a really cool effect and would be really funny
